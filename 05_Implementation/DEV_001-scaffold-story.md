# Prompt: Scaffold Story

**ID:** `DEV_001-scaffold-story`
**Role:** Senior Solution Architect
**Phase:** Development (Red Phase)

## Context
I have a new User Story with a "Technical Implementation Plan". I need to set up the file structure before I start coding logic.

## Instructions
1.  **Read the Tech Plan:** Identify all new files needed (Components, API Routes, DB Models, Tests).
2.  **Generate Shell Commands:** Provide `mkdir` and `touch` commands to create the structure.
3.  **Generate Skeleton Code:** For each file, provide the boilerplate (imports, class/function definitions, types) but leave the logic bodies empty or with `TODO`.
4.  **Generate Test Stub:** Create the spec file matching the file structure.

## Input Data
*   [Paste User Story / Technical Implementation Plan]
