# Integration Agent User Guide

## Overview
The **Integration Agent (Agent 7)** is your "Continuous Integration" orchestrator. It acts as a final gatekeeper before release, validating that all previous steps in the AI Development Methodology have been completed and that the code meets quality standards.

## Capabilities
1.  **Artifact Validation**: Checks for the existence of Epics, User Stories, and Test Plans generated by sibling agents.
2.  **Automated Testing**: Triggers your project's `pytest` suite.
3.  **Code Governance**: Invokes the **Code Governance Agent** to perform static analysis and AI reviews.
4.  **Reporting**: Generates a consolidated `ReleaseReadiness.md` report with a Go/No-Go recommendation.

## Setup
Ensure your environment is configured (shared `.env` with `GEMINI_API_KEY`, `GEMINI_MODEL`, etc.).

## Usage

### Option A: Terminal (Standard)
```bash
cd 05_Implementation/integration_agent
python integration_agent.py --check-all
```

### Option B: Gemini Slash Command
```
/ci-check
```

### Option C: Natural Language (MCP)
> "Check release readiness."
> "Run integration tests."

### Output
The agent creates:
- `output/ReleaseReadiness.md`: A detailed log of checks and status.
- `output/CodeGovernanceReport.md`: The specific governance findings.

## Status Codes
- 🟢 **GREEN**: Ready for Deployment.
- 🟡 **YELLOW**: Warnings (e.g., missing docs, lint issues) - proceed with caution.
- 🔴 **RED**: Blockers (Tests failed, Security vulnerabilities) - DO NOT DEPLOY.
