# The Design Hub

The Design Hub is the central repository for all design artifacts that inform the user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) of our applications. It serves as a bridge between the product requirements and the final implementation, ensuring that the visual and interactive elements of our software are consistent, intuitive, and aligned with user needs.

The Design Hub is a critical component of the AI-augmented software development lifecycle (SDLC), providing essential context for both human developers and AI assistants. It works in conjunction with the Architecture Hub and the Interaction Hub to provide a complete picture of the application.

## Anatomy of the Design Hub

The Design Hub is organized into the following sections:

| Section | Purpose & Content |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Wireframes** | Low-fidelity visual representations of the application's screens and user flows. Wireframes are used to establish the basic layout and structure of the UI before any detailed design work begins. They are stored in the `wireframes` directory. |
| **UI Mockups** | High-fidelity visual designs that provide a detailed representation of the final user interface. Mockups include color schemes, typography, and other visual elements. |
| **Design System** | A collection of reusable UI components, patterns, and guidelines that ensure consistency across the application. The design system includes elements such as buttons, forms, and navigation menus. |
