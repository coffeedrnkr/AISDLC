**Agent ID:** `UX_AGENT`
**Artifact:** Wireframes / Mockups / Personas

## 1. Completeness Checks (The Inventory)
*   [ ] **Screen Coverage:** Does every Functional Requirement (from PRD/Story) have a corresponding Screen or UI State?
*   [ ] **User Flow:** Is the navigation path between screens defined?
*   [ ] **Error States:** Are error states (e.g., "Network Failed") designed for critical flows?

## 2. Quality Checks (The Standard)
*   [ ] **Visual Hierarchy:** Is the primary action ("Call to Action") visually distinct?
*   [ ] **Accessibility:** Are colors high-contrast? Are touch targets large enough (>44px)?
*   [ ] **Consistency:** Does it use tokens from the Design System (Colors, Typography)?

## 3. Traceability Checks (The Red Thread)
*   [ ] **Visual Tagging:** Do diagram nodes include the Story ID? e.g., `Node["Login Screen (STORY-123)"]`
*   [ ] **Metadata Tagging:** Does the file include `%% @implements STORY-123`?
